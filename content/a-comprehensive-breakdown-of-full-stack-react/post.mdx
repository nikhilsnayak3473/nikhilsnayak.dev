## Introduction

Yes, you might have already guessed it from the title. Since React 19 is finally stable after the [Suspense Drama](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/react-19-and-suspense-a-drama-in-3-acts), complete with a neat solution called [Prewarming](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/29898#issuecomment-2477449973), we can finally dive deep into [**React Server Components**](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components). No more noise about them being experimental, canary, or any of that.

We'll explore React's full-stack architecture by building a simple full-stack app called **Cine Score**. In this app, users can browse a list of movies, up-vote or down-vote a movie, and search through the collection. Here's a sneak peek at what we'll create:

Not excited yet? ðŸ¤” What if I told you we'd build this app _without_ using any frameworks? Sounds exciting, right? ðŸŽ‰ Get ready, because we're going to rely solely on the tools provided by React and a few helper libraries.

By the end of this post, I aim to give you a _solid_ understanding of how RSC frameworks work under the hood. This way, you'll be able to use these frameworks wisely instead of fighting them.

## Project Setup

Weâ€™ll start with a clean slate and build everything step by step. For simplicity, we wonâ€™t be using TypeScript. If youâ€™d like to follow along, make sure you have the latest **LTS** version of Node.js installed.

Letâ€™s create a new Node.js project:

```bash
mkdir cine-score && cd cine-score && npm init -y
```

Install the following dependencies:

```bash
npm install express react react-dom webpack @babel/core @babel/register @babel/preset-react @babel/transform-modules-commonjs babel-loader
```

<CollapsibleContent summary="Overview of each dependency's role:">

- **webpack**: A bundler used to compile JavaScript for the browser.

- **@babel/core**: The core Babel library used to transform JSX into browser-compatible JavaScript.

- **@babel/register**: A runtime helper for Babel that enables on-the-fly transpilation of ES6+ and JSX in Node.js without pre-compilation.

- **@babel/preset-react**: A Babel preset for transpiling JSX and React-specific syntax into JavaScript.

- **@babel/transform-modules-commonjs**: A Babel plugin that transforms ES module syntax (`import`/`export`) into CommonJS (`require`/`module.exports`) for Node.js compatibility.

- **babel-loader**: A Webpack loader that integrates Babel to transpile JavaScript files during the build process.
